üß† Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Scans
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient system that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying the presence of brain tumors using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

üìù Project Description
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain, which can be life-threatening. Early and accurate detection is essential for effective treatment. This project uses a deep learning model trained on MRI images to classify whether an image shows a brain tumor or not.

The project is implemented as a full-stack web application, where users can upload an MRI scan image and receive a prediction. The backend is powered by Python (Flask + TensorFlow), and the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

üí° Features
Upload MRI images to check for the presence of brain tumors.

Deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras.

User-friendly web interface.

Fast and accurate predictions.

Medical-themed, clean UI design.
